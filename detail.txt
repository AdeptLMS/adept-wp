Hello ,

Today i have worked 3.5 hours on add meta tags for meeting post type.

Please find attched zip for latest code.

I have checked API calls but it still gives 401 authorization error. I think its session expire issue so please ask developer to remove session related functionality becuase client want to access API with out login.

Please ask API developer for Meeting API so we can start work on it.

Please start work on below Task:

1. Please add existing user validation for authorization page.
2. Please add validation for add only one user for API authentication and if user is already added than admin can update it means remove exsting and add new user.
3. Import course category using access token and fetch it from table.
4. Import courses using access token and fetch it from table.
